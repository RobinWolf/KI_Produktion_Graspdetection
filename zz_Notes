Error when running the demo.py:
    - Import of cupoch fails due to rrequirement of CUDA
        - cupoch is used for processing the 3D pointclouds on the GPU
        - https://github.com/neka-nat/cupoch

        --> all in the class ModelFreeCollisionDetector() --> maybe we can run the code without collision checking
